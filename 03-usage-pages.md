# 3 Usage Pages

- The following table lists the currently defined Usage Pages and the section in this document or the specification where each page is described.

|Page ID|Page Name|Section or Document|
|-|-|-|
|00|*Undefined*||
|01|Generic Desktop Page (0x01)|4|
|07|Keyboard/Keypad Page (0x07)|10|

## 3.1 HID Usage Table Conventions

- Usage ID 0 should always reserved.

- Usage ID 1 through 0x1F are reserved for *top level* collections.

- These Usage IDs are not necessarily application-level but are used to identify general device types.

- Usage page values are limited to 16 bits.

- Usages are 32-bit identifiers, where the high order 16 bits represents the Usage page and the low order 16 bits represents the Usage ID.

- To allow more compact Report descriptors, Usage Page items can be declared to specify the high order bits of the Usage item and the Usage items can declare only the ID portion of the Usage, as follows:

    - If the `bSize` field of the Usage item equals 1 or 2, the entire 1- or 2-byte data portion of the item is interpreted as a Usage ID.

    - If the `bSize` field equals 3, bits 16-31 of the 4-byte data portion of the item are interpreted as a Usage page, and bits 0-15 of the data portion are interpreted as a Usage ID.

        - This interpretation of Usages applies to Usage, Usage Minimum, and Usage Maximum items.

- The notation for a 32-bit Usage (sometimes called an extended Usage) in the examples is:

    ```
    Usage(Usage Page: Usage ID).
    ```

## 3.4 Usage Types

- Usages define a wide variety of device features.

- However, the way an application treats the data that they generate falls into a relatively small set of categories.

- This section provides descriptions of frequently used types of Usages, primarily to save redundant text throughout this document.

- This list is not an exhaustive list of the possible Usage Types.

- Individual Usage pages can declare their own Usage Types.

<br>

- Each Usage Types describes how an application should treat the data generated by the Main item that the Usage is attached to.

<br>

- Usage Type names are followed by an abbreviation that is used in the detailed Usage description to identify the default type of a Usage.

- In some cases Usage Types do not apply and the detailed description will identify how the Usage is to be interpreted.

<br>

- There are three basic types of information that are described by Usages: controls, collections, and data.

- In this context, controls are identified with the state of a device (on/off, enable/disable, and so forth), collections group related controls and data together, and data comprises the remaining information that is passed between a device and the host.

### 3.4.2 Usage Types (Data)

- The following table summarizes the data-related Usage Types.

|Abbreviation|Type|Flags|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|Sel|Selector|Array|Contained in a Named Array (NAry).|
|DV|Dynamic Value|Data, Variable, Absolute|A read/write multiple-bit value.|

#### 3.4.2.1 Selector (Sel)

- Selectors come in three forms:

    - N selections of a set.

        - More than one selection (button) can be valid at a time.

        - Multiple selections can be returned to the system at one time in a multi-byte array.

        - The *n selections of a set* form is defined by a Main item with the Array flag set and the Report Count set to *n*, where *n* is the number of selections that can be reported in a single report.

        - An example is a keyboard.

- Optionally, the array field or set can be named by wrapping a set of Selectors in a logical collection with a Usage attached to it.

- For details, see Section 3.4.3.1 Named Array (NAry)

#### 3.4.2.5 Dynamic Value (DV)

- A Dynamic Value is an *n*-bit field that contains a value associated with a control.

- The associated Main item will have the Data and Variable flags set.

- A Dynamic Value Main item must be declared as Data.

### 3.4.3 Usage Types (Collection)

- The following table summarizes the control related Usage Types.

|Control Type|Logical Min|Logical Max|Flags|Signal|Operation|

|Abbreviation|Type|Collection Type|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|CA|Application Collection|Application|Applies a name to a top level collection which the operating system uses to identify a device and possibly remap to a legacy API.|

#### 3.4.3.2 Collection Application (CA)

- The Collection Application Usage type identifies Usages that are used only in application-level collections.

- An application collection identifies a HID device or a functional subset of a complex device.

- An operating system uses the Usage associated with this collection to link the device to its controlling application or driver.

- Common examples are a keyboard or mouse.

- A keyboard with an integrated pointing device could contain two different application collections.

## 3.4.4 Alternate Types

- Usage Types are a guide, not the rule.

- The flags, Logical Minimum and Logical Maximum values, and other Main item attributes must be evaluated by application and system software to determine the true purpose, meaning, or interpretation of a control.

<br>

- In many cases, a Usage can take on the attributes of a Usage type other than its default type.

- The alternate type can be declared by a collection in which the Usage is found or implied by the way it is declared in a Report descriptor.

<br>

- However, when the device is running, only one mode will be in effect at a time.

- The device would then declare the same Usage as a Selector and report this in a Named Array field to identify the mode associated with the current data.

## 3.5 System Controls

- Applications look at the Usage applied to top-level application collections to identify devices.

- System software that supports keyboards, mice, and joysticks follow the same conventions.

- If a device vendor wants a device to be recognized by the system software as one of these devices, then the device must follow the conventions described in this section.

### 3.5.1 Keyboard

- Typical system software will search for application collections tagged with either a Keyboard or a Keypad Usage.

- When found, the Usages contained in these collections will be tested as standard system keyboard input.

- All devices that use these declarations will have their output routed to the same distribution.

- That is, typing on any device will affect the active application.

## 3.6 HID LANGIDs

- This section identifies a set of conventions that allow static data to be associated with individual controls.

- These conventions are an extension of the string descriptors that can currently be attached to controls.
